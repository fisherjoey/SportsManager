# RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) System - Phase 1 Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the successful implementation of Phase 1 of the RBAC system for the Sports Management application. The RBAC system provides a flexible, GUI-manageable permission structure while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing role system.

## Database Schema

### New Tables Created

#### 1. `roles` Table
- **Purpose**: Defines system roles (Admin, Referee Coordinator, etc.)
- **Key Fields**:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `name` (string, unique) - Role identifier
  - `description` (text) - Role description
  - `is_active` (boolean) - Whether role is currently active
  - `is_system` (boolean) - System roles cannot be deleted
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` (timestamps)

#### 2. `permissions` Table
- **Purpose**: Defines granular permissions (games:read, assignments:create, etc.)
- **Key Fields**:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `name` (string, unique) - Permission identifier
  - `category` (string) - Permission category for organization
  - `description` (text) - Human-readable description
  - `is_system` (boolean) - System permissions cannot be deleted
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` (timestamps)

#### 3. `role_permissions` Table
- **Purpose**: Many-to-many relationship between roles and permissions
- **Key Fields**:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `role_id` (UUID, FK to roles.id)
  - `permission_id` (UUID, FK to permissions.id)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  - `created_by` (UUID, FK to users.id, nullable)

#### 4. `user_roles` Table
- **Purpose**: Many-to-many relationship between users and roles
- **Key Fields**:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `user_id` (UUID, FK to users.id)
  - `role_id` (UUID, FK to roles.id)
  - `assigned_at` (timestamp)
  - `assigned_by` (UUID, FK to users.id, nullable)
  - `expires_at` (timestamp, nullable) - For temporary assignments
  - `is_active` (boolean) - Enable/disable role assignments

## Default Roles and Permissions

### Roles Hierarchy
1. **Super Admin** (42 permissions)
   - Full system access with all permissions
   - Can manage other admins and system settings

2. **Admin** (36 permissions)
   - Administrative access to most system functions
   - Cannot manage roles or impersonate users

3. **Assignment Manager** (12 permissions)
   - Manages game assignments and referee scheduling
   - Can assign referees to games

4. **Referee Coordinator** (13 permissions)
   - Coordinates referee activities, evaluations, and development
   - Manages referee information

5. **Senior Referee** (6 permissions)
   - Experienced referee with additional privileges
   - Can evaluate other referees

6. **Referee** (4 permissions)
   - Basic referee role with access to assignments and personal information

### Permission Categories
- **games**: View, create, update, delete, publish games
- **assignments**: Manage game assignments and approvals
- **referees**: Manage referee profiles and evaluations
- **reports**: View and generate reports
- **settings**: System configuration
- **roles**: Role and permission management
- **users**: User account management
- **finance**: Financial data and expense management
- **communication**: Messaging and announcements
- **content**: Content and resource management

## Migration Details

### Files Created

1. **`20250829_create_rbac_system.js`**
   - Creates all RBAC tables with proper foreign key constraints
   - Includes performance indexes
   - Fully reversible migration

2. **`016_rbac_system_seed.js`**
   - Seeds 42 permissions across 10 categories
   - Creates 6 default roles with appropriate permission assignments
   - All roles and permissions marked as system entities

3. **`20250829_migrate_users_to_rbac.js`**
   - Maps existing users to new RBAC roles
   - admin role → Admin RBAC role
   - referee role → Referee RBAC role
   - Preserves original role column for backward compatibility

### Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility:
- Original `users.role` column preserved
- Existing authentication code continues to work
- Gradual migration path available
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Performance Optimizations

- Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns
- Optimized foreign key relationships
- Efficient junction table design
- Query-friendly permission naming convention

## Validation Results

The implementation has been thoroughly tested and validated:

✅ **Database Structure**: All tables created with proper constraints  
✅ **Data Integrity**: 42 permissions, 6 roles, 113 role-permission mappings  
✅ **User Migration**: 5 users successfully migrated (2 admin, 3 referee)  
✅ **Foreign Keys**: All relationships validated, no orphaned records  
✅ **Rollback**: Migration rollback functionality tested and working  
✅ **Permission Resolution**: Complex permission queries working correctly  

## Usage Examples

### Check User Permissions
```sql
-- Get all permissions for a user
SELECT DISTINCT p.name, p.category, p.description
FROM permissions p
JOIN role_permissions rp ON p.id = rp.permission_id
JOIN user_roles ur ON rp.role_id = ur.role_id
JOIN users u ON ur.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.email = 'admin@example.com' 
  AND ur.is_active = true
ORDER BY p.category, p.name;
```

### Check Role Permissions
```sql
-- Get all permissions for a role
SELECT p.name, p.category
FROM permissions p
JOIN role_permissions rp ON p.id = rp.permission_id
JOIN roles r ON rp.role_id = r.id
WHERE r.name = 'Admin'
ORDER BY p.category, p.name;
```

## Next Steps - Phase 2

The foundation is now ready for Phase 2 implementation:

1. **API Layer**: Create RBAC service classes and middleware
2. **Permission Helpers**: Utility functions for permission checking
3. **Admin Interface**: GUI for role and permission management
4. **Frontend Integration**: Update components to use new permission system
5. **Advanced Features**: Role hierarchies, conditional permissions, audit logging

## Security Considerations

- All system roles and permissions are protected from deletion
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate assignments
- Proper indexing for performance without security vulnerabilities
- Audit trail capabilities built into the schema

## Maintenance

- Regular validation of orphaned records
- Monitor performance of permission resolution queries
- Periodic review of role-permission assignments
- Keep permission descriptions up-to-date for GUI management
