### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

1. **Status Badge Inconsistency**
   - Games show "Unassigned" (red) but should match ref count "0/2"
   - Same issue as Games Management page

2. **Referee Card Information**
   - Limited information visible (name, level, location, status)
   - Could show: availability dates, experience level, recent assignments

3. **No AI Suggestions Visible**
   - Screenshot shows pre-generation state
   - Can't evaluate AI suggestion UI/UX

4. **Game Card Actions**
   - No visible manual assignment option
   - Should allow fallback to manual assignment
