## Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

### 🔴 1. Status Logic Inconsistency (Games Management, AI Demo)
**Impact:** High - Confuses users, misrepresents data

**Issue:** Games show "Assigned" status badge while displaying "0/2 None assigned" referee count.

**Fix:**
```tsx
const getAssignmentStatus = (assigned: number, required: number) => {
  if (assigned === 0) return { label: 'Unassigned', color: 'gray' };
  if (assigned < required) return { label: 'Partial', color: 'yellow' };
  return { label: 'Assigned', color: 'green' };
};
```

---

### 🔴 2. Action Icon Touch Targets Too Small
**Impact:** High - Accessibility failure, poor mobile UX

**Issue:** View/Edit/Delete icons are ~16-20px, below WCAG 44x44px minimum.

**Pages Affected:** Games Management

**Fix:**
```tsx
<button
  aria-label="View game details"
  className="p-2 min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px] hover:bg-gray-700 rounded"
>
  <EyeIcon className="w-5 h-5" />
</button>
```

---

### 🔴 3. Input Field Contrast Issues
**Impact:** High - WCAG AA failure, readability problems

**Issue:** Dark input backgrounds with muted text may not meet 4.5:1 contrast ratio.

**Pages Affected:** Login, Broadcast Notifications

**Fix:**
```tsx
<Input
  className="bg-gray-800 text-gray-100 border-gray-600
             focus:border-blue-500 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"
/>
```

---

### 🔴 4. Missing Confirmation for High-Risk Actions
**Impact:** High - User error prevention

**Issue:** "Send to all users" broadcasts have no confirmation dialog.

**Pages Affected:** Broadcast Notifications

**Fix:**
```tsx
<AlertDialog>
  <AlertDialogContent>
    <AlertDialogTitle>Send to All Users?</AlertDialogTitle>
    <AlertDialogDescription>
      This will send the notification to every user in the system.
      This action cannot be undone.
    </AlertDialogDescription>
    <AlertDialogFooter>
      <AlertDialogCancel>Cancel</AlertDialogCancel>
      <AlertDialogAction onClick={handleSend}>Confirm</AlertDialogAction>
    </AlertDialogFooter>
  </AlertDialogContent>
</AlertDialog>
```

---

### 🔴 5. Loading States Need Improvement
**Impact:** High - Pages appear broken

**Issue:** Multiple pages stuck in loading state with "3 Issues" error badges.

**Pages Affected:** Budget Management, Financial Dashboard, Financial Budgets

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. Check authentication/permission issues
4. Review error badge implementation

---

### 🔴 6. No Mobile Responsive Design Visible
**Impact:** Critical - Platform unusable on mobile

**Issue:** Dense tables and layouts won't work on mobile devices.

**Pages Affected:** Games Management, Admin Permissions, all data tables

**Fix Strategy:**
- Implement card views for mobile (<768px)
- Hide non-essential columns on tablet
- Increase touch targets to 44x44px minimum
- Stack sections vertically

---

## Major Issues (Fix Soon)

### 🟡 1. Unclear Interaction Affordances
**Pages:** Admin Permissions, Games Management

Cards and elements lack hover states, cursors, and visual indicators showing they're interactive.

**Fix:** Add hover states, cursor:pointer, chevron icons for expandable items.

---

### 🟡 2. Search Functionality Hidden
**Pages:** Admin Permissions, Games Management

Search icons are small and easy to miss. Search bars should be expanded by default.

**Fix:** Expand search bars, increase size, make more prominent.

---

### 🟡 3. Empty States Lack Guidance
**Pages:** Resource Centre, Admin Permissions (potentially)

Empty states show "No X found" without actionable guidance or CTAs.

**Fix:** Add helpful messages, "Add Resource" buttons for admins, "Clear Filters" buttons.

---

### 🟡 4. No Error Recovery Actions
**Pages:** Admin Audit Logs, Budget Management

Error/access denied states don't provide next steps or navigation options.

**Fix:** Add "Go to Dashboard", "Contact Support", or "Retry" buttons.

---

## Design System Observations

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Consistent Dark Theme**
   - Professional appearance
   - Consistent card backgrounds (#1f1f1f, #2a2a2a)
   - Good use of elevation and shadows

2. **Icon + Text Patterns**
   - Most buttons have both icon and text
   - Reduces reliance on icon-only communication

3. **Typography Hierarchy**
   - Clear heading sizes and weights
   - Consistent spacing patterns

4. **Color Palette**
   - Blue (#4C9AFF) for primary actions
   - Red for errors/warnings
   - Green for success/available states
   - Gray tones for hierarchy

5. **Card-Based Layouts**
   - Consistent card structure
   - Good spacing and padding
   - Clear section separation

### ⚠️ Weaknesses

1. **Text Contrast Inconsistency**
   - Description text often too dim (#6b6b6b)
   - Needs standardization to meet WCAG AA

2. **Button Sizing Variation**
   - Some icon buttons too small
   - Need consistent minimum sizes

3. **No Documented Component Library**
   - Recommend creating Storybook
   - Document all UI patterns and variants

4. **Missing States**
   - Loading states inconsistent
   - Error states minimal
   - Success feedback often absent

## Accessibility Compliance

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Status

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)** | ⚠️ Partial | Input fields and muted text need improvement |
| **1.4.11 Non-text Contrast** | ⚠️ Partial | Some UI components below 3:1 ratio |
| **2.1.1 Keyboard** | ✅ Likely Pass | Tab navigation appears functional |
| **2.4.3 Focus Order** | ✅ Likely Pass | Logical tab order |
| **2.4.7 Focus Visible** | ❓ Unknown | Needs keyboard testing |
| **2.5.5 Target Size** | ❌ Fail | Action icons below 44x44px minimum |
| **3.2.4 Consistent Identification** | ✅ Pass | Consistent component patterns |
| **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value** | ⚠️ Partial | Some icons need ARIA labels |

**Overall WCAG AA Compliance:** ~65% (Estimated)

**Priority Fixes:**
1. Increase touch target sizes to 44x44px
2. Improve text contrast to meet 4.5:1 ratio
3. Add ARIA labels to icon-only buttons
4. Ensure visible focus indicators

---

## Performance Observations

### Loading Performance
- ⚠️ Multiple pages stuck in loading states
- ⚠️ No skeleton loaders to improve perceived performance
- ⚠️ No loading timeout handling

### Recommendations:
1. Implement skeleton loaders for all data-heavy pages
2. Add timeout handling (5-10 seconds)
3. Show specific error messages on failed loads
4. Add retry mechanisms

---

## User Experience Patterns

### ✅ Good Patterns Observed

1. **KPI Dashboards** (Permissions, AI Demo)
   - Clear metrics at page top
   - Provides quick overview
   - Good information hierarchy

2. **Tips Sidebar** (Broadcast Notifications)
   - Contextual help reduces support needs
   - Well-positioned, non-intrusive

3. **Live Summaries** (Broadcast Notifications)
   - Shows selection preview before action
   - Reduces errors

4. **Implementation Status** (AI Demo)
   - Transparent about feature maturity
   - Builds trust with stakeholders

### ❌ Problematic Patterns

1. **Horizontal Scroll for Categories**
   - Hard to navigate with keyboard
   - Users may not see all options
   - **Better:** Multi-row wrap or dropdown

2. **Dense Data Tables Without Mobile Strategy**
   - Unusable on small screens
   - **Better:** Card views, collapsible columns

3. **Icon-Only Actions**
   - Harder to understand, fails accessibility
   - **Better:** Icon + text or tooltips with ARIA
