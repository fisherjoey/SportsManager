## Error State Analysis

### Error Message Display

**‚úÖ Strengths:**
1. **Clear Error Communication**
   - Large "Access Denied" heading
   - Alert/info icon (circle with i)
   - Descriptive subtitle: "You don't have permission to view audit logs"
   - Technical error detail: "Failed to verify admin permissions. Please try again."

2. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Centered modal/card design draws attention
   - Error message in red-bordered box
   - Proper spacing between elements

3. **Dark Theme Consistency**
   - Matches overall application theme
   - Card has subtle border and shadow
   - Red error box provides contrast

**‚ùå Issues:**

1. **No Action Path**
   - No button to return to previous page
   - No link to request access
   - No "Go to Dashboard" or "Contact Admin" option
   - User is stuck without clear next action

2. **Technical Error Exposed**
   - "Failed to verify admin permissions" may confuse non-technical users
   - Could be simplified to "Access denied. Contact your administrator."

3. **Missing Context**
   - Doesn't explain what permissions are needed
   - Doesn't tell user who to contact for access
   - Doesn't suggest alternative actions

## Recommendations

### üî¥ High Priority

1. **Add Action Buttons**
   ```tsx
   <div className="flex gap-3 mt-6">
     <Button onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>
       Go to Dashboard
     </Button>
     <Button variant="outline" onClick={() => router.push('/help')}>
       Contact Support
     </Button>
   </div>
   ```

2. **Improve Error Message**
   - Primary: "You don't have permission to view audit logs"
   - Secondary: "This feature requires administrator privileges. Contact your system administrator to request access."
   - Hide technical error from end users

3. **Add Helpful Information**
   - Required permission: "audit:read"
   - Who to contact: "Contact your system administrator"
   - Link to help documentation

### üü° Medium Priority

4. **Add Breadcrumb/Back Navigation**
   - Allow user to navigate back without browser button

5. **Log Error for Debugging**
   - Capture failed permission check for admin review
   - Include user ID, timestamp, attempted resource

---

## Conclusion

Good error message clarity, but **lacks actionable next steps** for the user. The error state correctly prevents unauthorized access but leaves users without guidance.
