# Manual System Audit - Assignment Logic Focus

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Purpose**: Conduct thorough manual audit of assignment system on running environment
**Context**: Previous automated audit (Oct 17-18) may have inaccuracies - need ground truth

## üéØ Audit Objective

Determine the TRUE state of the Sports Manager assignment system by:
1. Testing actual functionality (not reading docs)
2. Documenting real errors (not theoretical issues)
3. Identifying genuine gaps (not assumptions)
4. Creating accurate fix list (prioritized by impact)
