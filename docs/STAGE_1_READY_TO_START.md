# ✅ Stage 1 Planning Complete - Ready to Execute

**Branch:** `feat/cerbos-authorization-rebase`
**Status:** READY TO START IMPLEMENTATION
**Date:** 2025-09-26

## 📦 What We've Delivered

### 1. Comprehensive Analysis Document
**File:** `docs/AUTHORIZATION_DECISION_ANALYSIS.md` (10,000+ words)

**Contents:**
- Technical debt analysis (build-your-own vs external service)
- Complete complexity comparison
- Real-world code examples
- 3-year cost analysis ($115k savings with external service)
- Migration path analysis
- Decision framework with scoring system
- Complete implementation templates

**Key Insight:** During a rebase/cleanup, external service (Cerbos) acts as **forcing function** for clean architecture.

### 2. Stage 1 Implementation Plan
**File:** `docs/CERBOS_MIGRATION_STAGE_1_PLAN.md` (2,500+ lines)

**Contents:**
- Complete current state audit (what's broken)
- Detailed DELETE list (what to remove)
- Detailed BUILD list (what to create)
- Day-by-day task breakdown (7 days)
- Database migration scripts (ready to use)
- Complete Cerbos service code (copy-paste ready)
- Initial policy templates (game, assignment)
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Success criteria checklist

## 🔍 Key Findings from Audit

### What's Broken

1. **Inconsistent Admin Checking (5 variations!)**
   ```typescript
   // Found in 5 different locations:
   if (userRoles.includes('admin') || userRoles.includes('Admin') ||
       userRoles.includes('Super Admin') || userRoles.includes('super admin') ||
       userRoles.includes('super_admin'))
   ```
   **Impact:** Case-sensitive bugs, authorization bypass risk

2. **Permission System Underutilized**
   - 76 files use old `requireRole` middleware
   - 45 files have direct role checks
   - Only ~15 files use `requirePermission` properly
   **Conclusion:** Permission system built but migration incomplete

3. **No Multi-Tenancy**
   - Zero `organization_id` columns on domain tables
   - Zero `region_id` columns
   - All users see all data
   **Blocker:** Can't scale to multiple organizations

4. **Mock Fallback in PermissionService**
   ```typescript
   // If service fails to load, returns false for everything
   permissionService = {
     hasPermission: () => Promise.resolve(false), // Silent failure!
   }
   ```
   **Risk:** Users mysteriously can't access anything if service breaks

### What's Good

✅ **Frontend is solid:**
- Clean RBAC UI components
- Good permission hooks
- Proper `hasPermission/hasRole` usage
- Just needs backend API changes

✅ **Foundation exists:**
- RoleService works
- PermissionService works (when loaded)
- Database migrations work
- JWT auth works

## 🎯 Stage 1 Goals (7 Days)

### Day 1: Database Foundation
- Create organizations, regions tables
- Add multi-tenancy columns
- Migrate existing data to default org
- Add performance indexes

### Day 2: Cerbos Infrastructure
- Deploy Cerbos (Docker Compose)
- Install SDK (`@cerbos/sdk`)
- Create type definitions
- Verify connectivity

### Day 3: Auth Service Layer
- Build `CerbosAuthService`
- Build helper functions (`toPrincipal`, `toResource`)
- Create new middleware (`requireCerbosPermission`)
- Write unit tests

### Day 4-5: Initial Policies
- Write schema definitions
- Write common derived roles
- Write game policy
- Write assignment policy (draft)
- Test policies with Cerbos CLI

### Day 6: Documentation
- Document removal plan (76 files to update)
- Create developer guide
- Update environment template
- Create troubleshooting guide

### Day 7: Integration Testing
- Test CerbosAuthService connectivity
- Test policy evaluation
- Performance testing (<20ms p95 target)
- Test sample route with multiple roles

## 📋 What You Need to Decide

### Decision 1: When to Start?
**Options:**
- **Start now** - I can begin Day 1 tasks immediately
- **Review first** - Read the docs, ask questions, then proceed
- **Need approval** - Get team buy-in before proceeding

**My Recommendation:** Review Stage 1 plan (20 min read), then start Day 1.

### Decision 2: Database Migration Timing
**Options:**
- **Dev database now** - Safe, reversible, test-friendly
- **Wait for staging** - More cautious approach
- **Coordinate with team** - If others are working on DB

**My Recommendation:** Dev database now. We have rollback scripts.

### Decision 3: Cerbos Deployment Strategy
**Options:**
- **Docker Compose locally** - Easiest for dev
- **Shared dev Cerbos** - If multiple devs working
- **Cloud deployment** - More production-like

**My Recommendation:** Docker Compose locally for Stage 1. Easy to tear down/rebuild.

## 🚦 Next Steps - Three Paths

### Path A: Start Implementation NOW ⭐
```
1. You say: "Let's start Day 1"
2. I create database migration files
3. I create seed data script
4. I run migration on dev DB
5. I verify data integrity
6. We proceed to Day 2

Timeline: ~2 hours for Day 1
```

### Path B: Review and Questions
```
1. You read CERBOS_MIGRATION_STAGE_1_PLAN.md
2. You ask questions/raise concerns
3. I adjust plan based on feedback
4. We proceed to Path A

Timeline: ~1 day (waiting for your review)
```

### Path C: Team Review/Approval
```
1. You share docs with team
2. Team reviews and discusses
3. Team decides on approach
4. We proceed when approved

Timeline: ~2-3 days (depending on team)
```

## 💡 Why Cerbos is Right (Summary)

**Your Context:** "Application is a bit of a mess after JS→TS migration. Auth is broken. Want to do it right and rebase."

**Why Cerbos Wins:**

1. **Forcing Function for Clean Code**
   - Can't integrate Cerbos with messy scattered checks
   - Forces you to centralize all auth logic
   - Forces you to think clearly about resources/actions
   - Policies become documentation

2. **Same Timeline, Better Outcome**
   - Build-your-own: 5 weeks, messy code
   - Cerbos: 5 weeks, clean architecture
   - Both work, but Cerbos enforces quality

3. **Rebase is Perfect Timing**
   - Already touching broken auth code
   - Already paying "rewrite cost"
   - Might as well get clean architecture
   - Not adding features, **fixing foundation**

4. **Your Gut Was Right**
   - You said: "Cerbos would allow us to do it right"
   - You said: "Could rebase things, fixing errors"
   - Your instinct is correct - trust it

## 🚀 I'm Ready When You Are

Just say the word and we'll begin implementation. Stage 1 is thoroughly planned, low-risk, and foundational.

**Recommended:** Start with Day 1 (database migration). It's reversible, well-documented, and essential for everything else.
