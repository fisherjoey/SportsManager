## Next Steps

### Phase 3 Preparation

Before migrating routes, we need to:

1. ✅ Verify all policies load in Cerbos
2. ✅ Test authorization rules
3. ✅ Create unit tests for policy management
4. ✅ Create integration tests
5. ⏭️ Start route migration (Phase 3)

**Status**: Ready for Phase 3

## Test Commands

```bash
# Run unit tests
cd backend
npm test

# Test Cerbos policy loading
npx ts-node src/test-cerbos-policies.ts

# Check Cerbos health
curl http://localhost:3592/_cerbos/health

# Verify specific resource
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
