## üö® Critical Decision: Why Not Fix Assignments First?

### Assignment System Investigation (Oct 20, 2025)

We just completed a thorough investigation of the assignment logic:
- **Backend**: 95% complete (4 bugs, 2-3h to fix)
- **Frontend**: 95% complete (3 TODOs, 1h to fix)

**However, we're deferring these fixes strategically.**

### The Problem

If we fix assignments now:
1. ‚úÖ Assignments work perfectly (2-3h)
2. ‚ùå Start building mentorship system
3. ‚ùå Need to add 12 database tables
4. ‚ùå User schema changes for mentorship
5. ‚ùå **Assignments break again** (depends on user schema)
6. üî• Rework assignments (another 2-3h wasted)

### The Smart Approach

Build foundation first:
1. ‚úÖ Add all 12 missing database tables
2. ‚úÖ Finalize user/referee schema
3. ‚úÖ Build P0 critical services
4. ‚úÖ **Schema is now stable**
5. ‚úÖ Fix assignments once (2-3h)
6. ‚úÖ Never touch them again
7. üí™ Save 3-5 hours total

## üìã Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1) - 30 hours

**Priority**: HIGHEST - Everything depends on this

#### Quick Wins (6 hours)
From audit checklist:
- [ ] Delete deprecated `permissionCheck.ts` middleware (1h)
- [ ] Add Cerbos migration banners to frontend (1h)
- [ ] Update README with authorization docs (1h)
- [ ] Verify no broken RBAC references (2h)
- [ ] Test critical user flows (1h)

**Why first**: Clears technical debt blocking progress

#### Database Foundation (24 hours)
Missing tables to create:

**Mentorship (8 tables)**:
- [ ] `mentor_profiles` - Mentor information and availability
- [ ] `mentee_profiles` - Mentee information and goals
- [ ] `mentorship_assignments` - Mentor-mentee pairings
- [ ] `mentorship_sessions` - Session scheduling and tracking
- [ ] `mentorship_goals` - Goal setting and progress
- [ ] `mentorship_feedback` - Session feedback and ratings
- [ ] `mentorship_program_enrollments` - Program participation
- [ ] `mentorship_availability` - Mentor availability schedules

**Compliance (2 tables)**:
- [ ] `compliance_records` - Certification and compliance tracking
- [ ] `compliance_requirements` - Required certifications by level

**Employee Management (2 tables)**:
- [ ] `employees` - Staff and administrative employees
- [ ] `employee_roles` - Employee role assignments

**Why this order**: Database schema is the foundation. Changing it later breaks everything.

**Deliverables**:
- ‚úÖ All migrations written and tested
- ‚úÖ Seed data for new tables
- ‚úÖ Schema documentation updated
- ‚úÖ Foreign key constraints verified

## ü§î Common Questions

### Q: Why not fix assignments first since they're almost done?

**A:** Because we'd likely have to fix them again after database schema changes. Building foundation first saves 3-5 hours and prevents rework.

**Full explanation:** [audit-2025-10-18/assignment/README.md](./audit-2025-10-18/assignment/README.md)

---

### Q: What's the fastest path to something demo-able?

**A:** If you have a demo tomorrow:
- Fix assignments (3h) - they work in isolation
- Use existing features for demo
- Come back to foundation work after

If no immediate demo:
- Follow the phase order (foundation first)
- More efficient long-term
- Stable, production-ready result

---

### Q: Can we do assignments and foundation in parallel?

**A:** Risky. Schema changes during foundation work could break assignments. Better to:
1. Finalize schema (Phase 1)
2. Build on stable foundation (Phase 2-3)
3. Polish features (Phase 4+)

---

### Q: What if priorities change?

**A:** The phases are flexible:
- Each phase delivers working features
- Can re-prioritize between phases
- Can skip P3 features if needed
- Foundation (Phase 1) is non-negotiable
