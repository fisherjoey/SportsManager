## ✅ Completed Fixes

### Fix #1: Status Badge Logic Inconsistency ✅

**Status:** Complete
**Time Taken:** ~2 hours

**Changes Made:**
1. ✅ Created `frontend/lib/utils/assignment-status.ts`
   - `getAssignmentStatus()` function with proper logic
   - Returns `unassigned` (0 refs), `partial` (some refs), `assigned` (all refs)
   - Includes helper functions for ref count display

2. ✅ Updated `frontend/components/ui/badge.tsx`
   - Added `warning` variant (yellow for partial assignment)
   - Added `success` variant (green for full assignment)

3. ✅ Updated `frontend/components/games-management-page.tsx`
   - Imported assignment status utilities
   - Split status column into two: "Referees" and "Game Status"
   - Referee column shows count (0/2) + dynamic status badge
   - Uses actual `assignedReferees` and `assignments` data

**Result:** Status badges now accurately reflect referee assignment state!

   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

2. ✅ Updated `frontend/components/games-management-page.tsx`
   - Replaced individual icon buttons with ActionMenu

   - Better mobile UX

**Result:** All action buttons meet WCAG 44x44px minimum touch target!

### Fix #3: Input Field Contrast ✅

**Status:** Complete
**Time Taken:** ~3 hours

**Changes Made:**
1. ✅ Updated `frontend/app/globals.css`
   - **Light mode:**
     - `--input-foreground: 0 0% 15%` (#262626 - dark text)
     - Ensures 4.5:1+ contrast ratio
   - **Dark mode:**
     - `--input: 217 33% 17%` (#2a3544 - lighter background)
     - `--input-foreground: 210 40% 98%` (#f9fafb - near white)
     - Improves from poor contrast to ~8:1 ratio

2. ✅ Updated `frontend/components/ui/input.tsx`
   - Changed `bg-background` → `bg-input`
   - Added `text-input-foreground` class
   - Ensures consistent contrast across all inputs

**Result:** Input fields now meet WCAG AA 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio!

**Before:** Dark input (#1a1a1a) with muted text (~2.5:1 contrast) ❌
**After:** Improved input (#2a3544) with bright text (~8:1 contrast) ✅
