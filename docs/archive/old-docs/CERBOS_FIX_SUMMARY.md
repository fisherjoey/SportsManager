# Cerbos Fix Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Issue:** Cerbos crash-looping, permissions failing

---

## Problem

Cerbos container was in a **crash-loop** (restarting every minute):

```
STATUS: Restarting (1) 57 seconds ago
ERROR: failed to build index: load failures=1
```

Permission checks in your app were all failing with:
```
[ERROR] Permission check failed
principal: 3b5b94f3-a700-4c59-a297-5dcb543d372d
resource: game:game-xxx
action: list
```

---

## Root Cause

**Invalid Cerbos policy** in `cerbos/policies/user.yaml`:

```yaml
# Lines 27-28 had duplicate action:
- actions:
    - view
    - view    # ← DUPLICATE!
  effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
  roles:
    - basictestrole
```

Cerbos validation error:
```
resourcePolicy.rules[2].actions: repeated value must contain unique items
Position: line 27, column 7
```

Cerbos refuses to start with invalid policies (security-by-default).

---

## Fix Applied

**Removed duplicate `view` action:**

```bash
# Fixed cerbos/policies/user.yaml line 28
- actions:
    - view    # Only one now
  effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
  roles:
    - basictestrole
```

---

## Verification

✅ **Cerbos Started Successfully:**
```
{"log.level":"info","message":"Found 42 executable policies"}
{"log.level":"info","message":"Starting HTTP server at :3592"}
{"log.level":"info","message":"Starting gRPC server at :3593"}
```

✅ **Health Check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3592/_cerbos/health
# Response: {"status":"SERVING"}
```

✅ **Container Status:**
```
docker ps | grep cerbos
# STATUS: Up 11 seconds (healthy)
```

✅ **Policy Validation:**
```bash
npm run cerbos:validate
# Loaded 42 Cerbos policies
# Coverage: 100%
```

---

## Policies Loaded

All **42 policies** now load successfully:

| Resource | Actions | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| game | 23 actions | ✅ |
| assignment | 14 actions | ✅ |
| user | 11 actions | ✅ FIXED |
| role | 7 actions | ✅ |
| referee | 8 actions | ✅ |
| communication | wildcard (*) | ✅ |
| ... | ... | ✅ |

**Total:** 42 resource policies, 300+ individual permission rules

---

## How to Prevent This

### 1. **Pre-commit Validation**

The pre-commit hook validates policies before commit:

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit runs:
npm run cerbos:validate
```

If you try to commit invalid policies, you'll see:
```
❌ Cerbos policy coverage check failed!
   Missing policies or invalid syntax detected.
```

### 2. **CI/CD Pipeline Check**

GitHub Actions workflow validates on PR:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-checks.yml
- name: Validate Cerbos policies
  run: npm run cerbos:validate:verbose
```

### 3. **Manual Validation**

Before editing policies:

```bash
# Validate all policies
npm run cerbos:validate:verbose

# Check Cerbos logs
npm run logs:cerbos

# Restart if needed
npm run restart:cerbos
```

## Common Cerbos Errors

### 1. Duplicate Actions
```yaml
❌ WRONG:
- actions:
    - view
    - view

✅ CORRECT:
- actions:
    - view
```

### 2. Invalid Role Names
```yaml
❌ WRONG (space in role):
roles:
  - Super Admin

✅ CORRECT (underscore):
roles:
  - super_admin
```

### 3. Missing Imports
```yaml
❌ WRONG:
importDerivedRoles:
  - non_existent_role

✅ CORRECT:
importDerivedRoles:
  - common_roles  # Must exist
```

### 4. Invalid Action Names
```yaml
❌ WRONG (typo):
- actions:
    - veiw  # Typo

✅ CORRECT:
- actions:
    - view
```

## Troubleshooting Checklist

If Cerbos isn't working:

- [ ] Check container status: `docker ps | grep cerbos`
- [ ] View logs: `npm run logs:cerbos`
- [ ] Check health: `curl http://localhost:3592/_cerbos/health`
- [ ] Validate policies: `npm run cerbos:validate:verbose`
- [ ] Look for errors in logs (search for `"log.level":"error"`)
- [ ] Restart container: `npm run restart:cerbos`
