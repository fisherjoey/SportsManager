# ✅ Cerbos Super Admin Fix - Status Update

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ User Successfully Re-logged In
- You logged out and logged back in with `admin@test.com`
- Your JWT token now correctly includes: `roles: ["super_admin"]`
- Backend logs confirm: `JWT decoded - Roles array: [ 'super_admin' ]`

### 2. ✅ Cerbos Policies Updated
I've updated the following Cerbos policy files to grant `super_admin` wildcard (`*`) access:

- **[cerbos/policies/game.yaml](cerbos/policies/game.yaml#L9-L13)** - Added `super_admin` with `['*']` actions
- **[cerbos/policies/mentorship.yaml](cerbos/policies/mentorship.yaml#L7-L11)** - Added `super_admin` with `['*']` actions
- **[cerbos/policies/team.yaml](cerbos/policies/team.yaml#L7-L11)** - Added `super_admin` with `['*']` actions
- **[cerbos/policies/league.yaml](cerbos/policies/league.yaml#L7-L11)** - Added `super_admin` with `['*']` actions

### 3. ✅ Cerbos Container Restarted
- Cerbos Docker container was restarted **TWICE** (final restart: **just now**)
- All updated policies have been reloaded
- Status: `Up and Running`
- Loaded: **43 executable policies**
- Watching directory: `/policies` for changes

## ⚡ Next Step: TEST THE FIX

**Please refresh your browser or make a new API request to test if permissions work now.**

The Cerbos restart happened after your last login attempt, so the new policies should now be active.

### Expected Behavior
With `super_admin` role, you should now have **full access** to:
- ✅ Games (`/api/games`)
- ✅ Mentorships (`/api/mentorships`)
- ✅ Teams
- ✅ Leagues
- ✅ All other resources

### If It Still Doesn't Work
If you still see permission errors after refreshing:

1. **Check if other policies need updating**
   - The fix was applied to `game`, `mentorship`, `team`, and `league`
   - Other resources (referee, venue, etc.) may also need the wildcard rule

2. **Verify Cerbos connection**
   - Check backend logs for Cerbos connection errors
   - Ensure Docker is still running

3. **Report the specific resource failing**
   - Which API endpoint is failing?
   - What action are you trying to perform?

## Technical Details

### Cerbos Container Info
- **Container**: `sportsmanager-cerbos`
- **Image**: `ghcr.io/cerbos/cerbos:latest`
- **Ports**: 3592 (HTTP), 3593 (gRPC)
- **Policies**: Mounted from `./cerbos/policies` (read-only)
- **Last Restart**: 03:23 UTC (just now)

### Policy Structure
```yaml
# Example: game.yaml
rules:
  - actions: ['*']          # Wildcard = all actions
    effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
    roles:
      - super_admin
    name: super-admin-full-access
```

This gives `super_admin` role unrestricted access to all actions on the resource.
