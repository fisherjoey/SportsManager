# RBAC ‚Üí Cerbos Migration Cleanup Analysis

**Analysis Date**: October 18, 2025
**Migration Date**: September 27, 2025
**Status**: üü° Partial Migration - Significant Cleanup Required

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

### Critical Finding
On September 27, 2025, a migration **permanently dropped** the `permissions` and `role_permissions` tables from the database as part of migrating from database-backed RBAC to Cerbos (YAML-based authorization). However, **extensive legacy code remains** that references the old permission system.

### Impact on Gap Analysis
Of the **87 total "missing/partial" endpoints** identified in the implementation gap analysis:
- **~15 endpoints (17%)** are RBAC-related cleanup tasks (DELETE or REFACTOR)
- **~72 endpoints (83%)** are genuinely new features that need to be built
- **Revised implementation effort**: ~220-235 hours (down from 249 hours)

### Migration Status Breakdown
| Component | Status | % Complete | Action Required |
|-----------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Database** | üü° Partial | 60% | Drop 5 remaining legacy tables |
| **Backend Routes** | üü¢ Mostly Done | 85% | Refactor permissions endpoint, delete deprecated middleware |
| **Backend Services** | üü¢ Complete | 95% | Clean up RBACRegistryService integration |
| **Frontend Components** | üî¥ Incomplete | 30% | Major refactor needed for 4+ components |
| **Middleware** | üü° Partial | 70% | Delete deprecated permissionCheck.ts |

## üóëÔ∏è Endpoints to DELETE (Legacy RBAC)

### DELETE - P0 Critical (Immediate Action Required)

None identified - the critical permissions endpoints have been successfully refactored to use static data instead of database queries.

### DELETE - P1 High (Should Remove Soon)

#### Backend Middleware
- **DELETE** `backend/src/middleware/permissionCheck.ts` **(2 hours)**
  - Status: Marked as deprecated with `@ts-nocheck`
  - Uses: Deprecated `PermissionService` (always returns false)
  - Replace with: Already replaced - all routes should use `requireCerbosPermission`
  - Impact: Low - appears unused based on deprecation warnings
  - Search codebase first: `grep -r "permissionCheck\|requirePermissions" backend/src/routes/`

### DELETE - P2 Medium (Consider Removing)

#### RBAC Registry System (Depends on Strategic Decision)

**If RBAC Registry is no longer needed**:
- **DELETE** `backend/src/services/RBACRegistryService.ts` (1 hour)
- **DELETE** `backend/src/routes/admin/rbac-registry.ts` (0.5 hours)
- **DELETE** `backend/src/startup/rbac-scanner-init.ts` (0.5 hours)
- **DELETE** Frontend `RBACRegistryDashboard.tsx` component (if exists) (1 hour)
- **DROP** Database tables: `rbac_pages`, `rbac_endpoints`, `rbac_functions`, `rbac_scan_history`, `rbac_configuration_templates` (0.5 hours)
- **Total**: 3.5 hours

**Strategic Question**: Does the RBAC Registry system still serve a purpose?
- **Original Purpose**: Automated discovery and registration of pages, endpoints, and functions for permission management
- **Current Reality**: Permissions are now defined in Cerbos YAML policies, not in a database
- **Potential Value**: Could be refactored to auto-generate Cerbos policy templates from codebase scans
- **Recommendation**: **DELETE** unless there's a specific plan to integrate it with Cerbos policy generation

---

## üîß Endpoints to REFACTOR (Incomplete Migration)

### REFACTOR - P0 Critical (Affects Current Functionality)

None identified - critical endpoints have been successfully migrated.

### REFACTOR - P1 High (Should Complete Soon)

#### 1. RBAC Registry Endpoints (if keeping the system)
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/rbac-registry/*` endpoints
- **Current**: Queries legacy `rbac_*` tables for page/endpoint discovery
- **Should**: Either (A) integrate with Cerbos policy generation, or (B) delete entirely
- **Effort**: 8 hours (if refactoring to generate Cerbos policies) OR 3.5 hours (if deleting)
- **Recommendation**: **DELETE** - the registry concept doesn't align well with Cerbos's file-based policies

#### 2. Frontend Permission Components
**Components**: `PermissionManagementDashboard.tsx`, `PermissionSelector.tsx`
- **Current**: Display permissions from `/api/admin/permissions` (now returns static hardcoded list)
- **Issue**: UI implies permissions are editable database records, but they're actually static constants
- **Should**:
  - **Option A**: Refactor to display Cerbos policy actions and resources (read from policy files)
  - **Option B**: Simplify to show "Available Permissions" as a reference guide only (read-only)
- **Effort**: 6 hours (Option A) or 2 hours (Option B)
- **Recommendation**: **Option B** - make it a read-only reference until Cerbos policy UI is built

#### 3. UnifiedAccessControlDashboard Component
**Component**: `UnifiedAccessControlDashboard.tsx`
- **Current**: Partially migrated - shows roles and page access
- **Should**: Complete migration to use Cerbos principal roles and resource policies
- **Effort**: 4 hours
- **Action**: Verify it's not querying dropped tables, ensure it only uses Cerbos-compatible endpoints

### REFACTOR - P2 Medium (Nice to Have)

#### Role Management - Cerbos Policy Sync
**Endpoints**: `POST /api/admin/roles`, `PUT /api/admin/roles/:id`
- **Current**: Create/update roles in database only
- **Should**: Also generate/update corresponding Cerbos derived role policies
- **Effort**: 8 hours
- **Files to update**: `backend/src/routes/admin/roles.ts`, create new `CerbosPolicyGenerator` service
- **Benefit**: Keep database roles and Cerbos policies in sync automatically

## ‚úÖ Endpoints to BUILD (Genuinely Missing Features)

### Summary
The vast majority of the 87 "missing/partial" endpoints identified in the gap analysis are **genuinely new features** unrelated to the RBAC‚ÜíCerbos migration:

| Category | Count | RBAC-Related? | Genuine Features |
|----------|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **P0 Critical** | 15 | 2 (RBAC Registry) | 13 (Mentorship, Communications, Financial Dashboard) |
| **P1 High** | 22 | 0 | 22 (Expenses, Employees, Compliance, Content, Analytics) |
| **P2 Medium** | 18 | 0 | 18 (Enhancements to existing features) |
| **P3 Low** | 32 | ~5 (Unified roles, Access control stats) | ~27 (Mentorship extended, Mentee analytics) |
| **TOTAL** | **87** | **~7 (8%)** | **~80 (92%)** |

### Genuinely Missing Endpoints (High Priority Examples)

#### P0 Critical - Mentorship System (24 hours)
- `GET /api/mentees/:menteeId` - Get mentee profile (6 hours)
- `GET /api/mentees/:menteeId/games` - Get mentee game assignments (8 hours)
- `GET /api/mentees/:menteeId/analytics` - Get mentee analytics (6 hours)
- `GET /api/mentors/:mentorId/mentees` - Get mentor's mentees (4 hours)

**Reason**: Completely new feature domain - not related to RBAC migration

#### P0 Critical - Communications System (12 hours)
- `GET /api/communications` - List communications with filtering (6 hours)
- `POST /api/communications/:id/publish` - Publish communication (6 hours)

**Reason**: New business feature - not related to permissions

#### P0 Critical - Financial Dashboard (7 hours)
- `GET /api/financial-dashboard` - Comprehensive dashboard data (7 hours)

**Reason**: Aggregation endpoint for existing financial data - not RBAC-related

**See original gap analysis files for complete list of 80+ genuinely missing endpoints**

## üìù Key Questions for Product/Engineering Team

### Strategic Questions

1. **RBAC Registry System**: Should we keep, refactor, or delete it?
   - **Context**: The registry was designed to auto-discover pages/endpoints for the old database-backed permission system
   - **Current Value**: Unclear - Cerbos uses YAML files, not database discovery
   - **Options**:
     - **Option A**: Delete entirely (saves 3.5 hours, reduces complexity)
     - **Option B**: Refactor to generate Cerbos policy templates from code scans (requires 8+ hours)
     - **Option C**: Keep as-is for future use (maintains status quo)
   - **Recommendation**: **Option A (Delete)** - doesn't align with Cerbos architecture

2. **Permission Management UI**: Do we need users to edit permissions via UI?
   - **Context**: Currently permissions are hardcoded in `backend/src/routes/admin/permissions.ts`
   - **Cerbos Reality**: Permissions are defined in YAML files (`cerbos-policies/`)
   - **Options**:
     - **Option A**: Build Cerbos policy file editor UI (large effort, 20+ hours)
     - **Option B**: Keep YAML-based workflow (developers edit files, deploy changes)
     - **Option C**: Hybrid - UI for common tasks, YAML for advanced scenarios
   - **Recommendation**: **Option B** - start with YAML workflow, add UI later if needed

3. **Role-Cerbos Policy Sync**: Should database roles auto-generate Cerbos policies?
   - **Context**: Currently roles exist in DB, policies exist in YAML files (manually kept in sync)
   - **Risk**: Roles and policies could drift out of sync
   - **Options**:
     - **Option A**: Auto-generate Cerbos derived role policies when roles are created/updated
     - **Option B**: Manual sync (current state)
     - **Option C**: Make Cerbos policies the source of truth, read roles from policies
   - **Recommendation**: **Option A** - reduces sync issues, improves reliability

### Technical Questions

4. **Migration Verification**: How do we verify no functionality is broken?
   - Need comprehensive testing of all user roles and permission scenarios
   - Suggested: Create test matrix of (Role √ó Resource √ó Action) combinations

5. **Error Handling**: What should users see when Cerbos denies access?
   - Current: Generic "Forbidden" message
   - Better: Specific message like "You need 'game:create' permission to create games"

6. **Performance**: Is Cerbos caching working effectively?
   - Check: Logs show cache hit rates
   - Monitor: Response times for permission checks
   - Optimize: Increase cache TTL if hit rates are low

- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Clear guides exist for managing Cerbos policies
- ‚úÖ **Testing**: All permission scenarios work correctly with Cerbos
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Cerbos authorization has acceptable latency (< 50ms p95)

### Cleanup is Complete When:
- ‚úÖ No deprecated middleware files exist
- ‚úÖ No confusion about where permissions are defined (YAML vs DB)
- ‚úÖ RBAC Registry decision made (keep/refactor/delete)
- ‚úÖ Frontend components are honest about permission editability
- ‚úÖ Team is trained on Cerbos policy development
