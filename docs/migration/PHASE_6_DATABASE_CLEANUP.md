# Phase 6: Database Cleanup - Legacy Table Drop

## Completion Date: 2025-09-27

## Summary
Successfully dropped legacy RBAC tables (`permissions` and `role_permissions`) from the database after completing full migration to Cerbos authorization system.

## Pre-Drop State
- **permissions table**: 62 records
- **role_permissions table**: 184 role-permission assignments
- All routes confirmed using Cerbos authorization
- Zero active code references to legacy tables

## Actions Taken
1. Final verification check: No database queries to legacy tables found
2. Logged current data counts for reference
3. Dropped `role_permissions` table (foreign key constraint order)
4. Dropped `permissions` table
5. Verified tables successfully removed

## Post-Drop State
- ✅ `permissions` table: REMOVED
- ✅ `role_permissions` table: REMOVED
- ✅ `roles` table: PRESERVED (still needed for Cerbos principals)
- ✅ `user_roles` table: PRESERVED (still needed for Cerbos principals)

## SQL Executed
```sql
BEGIN;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS role_permissions CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS permissions CASCADE;
COMMIT;
```

## Verification
- Tables confirmed deleted via `\dt` commands
- No errors during drop operation
- Application continues to function normally with Cerbos

## Notes
- **Irreversible**: Original permission data permanently deleted
- **Safe**: All authorization now handled by Cerbos YAML policies
- **Clean**: No code references legacy tables
- **Complete**: All 6 phases of CERBOS_MIGRATION_PLAN.md finished

## Rollback
Not possible - data is permanently deleted. To restore:
1. Would need to recreate tables from scratch
2. Re-seed all 62 permissions manually
3. Re-assign all 184 role-permission mappings manually
4. **Would conflict with Cerbos** - not recommended

## Success Criteria Met
✅ No application errors after table drop
✅ All routes still accessible via Cerbos
✅ Frontend permission checks working
✅ Database cleanup complete
