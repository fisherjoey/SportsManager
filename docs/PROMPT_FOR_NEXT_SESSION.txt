I need you to complete the Cerbos policy creation for my SportsManager application.

CONTEXT:
Super Admin was getting "403 Forbidden" on API calls. We fixed the root cause (Cerbos was using SQLite instead of loading YAML files) and now it's working for 3 resources (user, game, assignment). But 38 other resources still need policy files created.

YOUR TASK:
1. Read the file SESSION_SUMMARY.md to understand what was fixed
2. Run the script: ./create_cerbos_policies.sh
3. Verify all 41 policies are loaded
4. Test that the API endpoints work

The script will automatically:
- Create 38 individual YAML policy files in cerbos/policies/
- Restart Cerbos
- Show you the policy count

VERIFICATION:
After running the script, confirm:
- Cerbos shows "Found 41 executable policies"
- API endpoints return data (not 403 errors)
- Run this test command:

curl -s "http://localhost:3001/api/teams" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

Should return JSON data, not a 403 error.

DOCUMENTATION:
All details are in these files:
- SESSION_SUMMARY.md - What was fixed and current state
- QUICK_START.md - Quick reference
- CERBOS_POLICY_CREATION_PLAN.md - Complete technical guide
- README_CERBOS_FIX.md - Overview and index

PROJECT LOCATION:
C:\Users\School\OneDrive\Desktop\SportsManager-pre-typescript

Just run the script and verify it worked. The script is ready to go.
