## Risk Assessment

### High Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Database migration failures** | Medium | High | Test on staging first, have rollback plan |
| **Mentorship system complexity** | High | High | Start early, allocate extra buffer time |
| **Performance issues with analytics** | Medium | Medium | Use caching, background jobs |
| **Cerbos integration challenges** | Low | High | Early prototyping, documentation review |
| **File storage setup delays** | Low | Medium | Use cloud service (AWS S3) for simplicity |

### Medium Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **API response format inconsistencies** | High | Low | Create transformation layer early |
| **Frontend requires API changes** | Medium | Low | Regular frontend/backend sync meetings |
| **Test coverage gaps** | Medium | Low | Enforce 80% coverage threshold |
