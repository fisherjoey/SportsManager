## âš¡ IMMEDIATE - Quick Wins (This Week, 6 hours)

**Goal**: Clean up RBAC migration remnants and prepare codebase

### 1. Delete Deprecated Permission Middleware (2 hours)

**Impact**: Removes dead code, prevents confusion, improves code quality

**File to Delete**: `backend/src/middleware/permissionCheck.ts`

**Steps**:
- [ ] Search for any remaining usage:
  ```bash
  grep -r "requirePermissions\|checkRoutePermission\|permissionCheck" backend/src/
  ```
- [ ] Verify search results show only deprecated warnings
- [ ] Delete the file: `rm backend/src/middleware/permissionCheck.ts`
- [ ] Remove any import statements found in search
- [ ] Test backend startup: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Verify no errors in console

**Expected Result**: âœ… File deleted, no errors, cleaner codebase

---

### 2. Add Migration Complete Banners to Frontend (1 hour)

**Impact**: Clarifies to users that permissions are now in Cerbos YAML files

**Files to Update**:
- `frontend/components/admin/rbac/PermissionManagementDashboard.tsx`
- `frontend/components/admin/rbac/UnifiedAccessControlDashboard.tsx`

**Steps**:
- [ ] Add info banner at top of PermissionManagementDashboard:
  ```tsx
  <Alert variant="info" className="mb-4">
    <AlertCircle className="h-4 w-4" />
    <AlertTitle>Cerbos Migration Complete</AlertTitle>
    <AlertDescription>
      Permissions are now defined in Cerbos policy files
      (cerbos-policies/*.yaml). This dashboard is for reference only.
      <a href="/docs/cerbos" className="underline ml-2">Learn more</a>
    </AlertDescription>
  </Alert>
  ```
- [ ] Disable any "Edit Permission" or "Create Permission" buttons (if they exist)
- [ ] Add similar banner to UnifiedAccessControlDashboard
- [ ] Test frontend renders correctly
- [ ] Take screenshot for documentation

**Expected Result**: âœ… Users understand permissions are in Cerbos

---

### 3. Update README with Authorization Documentation (1 hour)

**Impact**: Improves developer onboarding, reduces confusion

**File to Update**: `README.md`

**Steps**:
- [ ] Add new section after "Installation":
  ```markdown
  ## Authorization

  This application uses **Cerbos** for role-based access control (RBAC).

  ### How Permissions Work

  1. **Roles** are stored in the database (`roles` table)
  2. **Permissions** are defined in Cerbos YAML policy files (`cerbos-policies/`)
  3. **Authorization** is checked via Cerbos at runtime

  ### Adding New Permissions

  To add a new permission:

  1. Edit the appropriate Cerbos policy file in `cerbos-policies/resources/`
  2. Add the permission action (e.g., `game:create`)
  3. Deploy the updated policy files
  4. Test using the Cerbos playground or integration tests

  ### Migration Note

  As of September 27, 2025, we migrated from database-backed permissions
  to Cerbos YAML policies. The old `permissions` and `role_permissions`
  tables have been dropped.

  **Policy Files**: `cerbos-policies/`
  **Documentation**: [Cerbos Docs](https://docs.cerbos.dev/)
  ```
- [ ] Verify formatting renders correctly
- [ ] Add link to Cerbos documentation in "Additional Resources" section

**Expected Result**: âœ… Clear documentation for developers

---

### 4. Verify No Broken RBAC References (1 hour)

**Impact**: Confirms migration completeness, prevents runtime errors

**Steps**:
- [ ] Search for references to dropped tables:
  ```bash
  grep -r "role_permissions\|permissions.*table" backend/src/ --include="*.ts"
  ```
- [ ] For each result found:
  - Determine if code is active or deprecated
  - If active and broken, add to bug list
  - If deprecated, note for deletion
- [ ] Search for old middleware usage:
  ```bash
  grep -r "requirePermissions" backend/src/routes/ --include="*.ts"
  ```
- [ ] Document findings in a new file: `RBAC_MIGRATION_AUDIT.md`
- [ ] Create issues for any broken code found

**Expected Result**: âœ… Audit report, list of issues (if any)

---

### 5. Test Critical User Flows (1 hour)

**Impact**: Ensures Cerbos authorization works correctly in production scenarios

**Test Accounts** (from seed file `002_test_users.js`):
- `admin@sportsmanager.com` / `admin123` (Super Admin)
- `assignor@cmba.ca` / `admin123` (Assignment Manager)
- `senior.ref@cmba.ca` / `referee123` (Senior Referee)
- `referee@test.com` / `referee123` (Junior Referee)

**Steps**:
- [ ] Test 1: Login as Super Admin
  - Verify can access `/admin/roles`
  - Verify can create new role
  - Verify can assign permissions

- [ ] Test 2: Login as Assignment Manager
  - Verify can access `/games`
  - Verify can create game assignments
  - Verify CANNOT access `/admin/roles` (should be forbidden)

- [ ] Test 3: Login as Junior Referee
  - Verify can view assigned games
  - Verify can accept/decline assignments
  - Verify CANNOT create games (should be forbidden)

- [ ] Test 4: Permission Edge Cases
  - Test accessing API endpoint directly (without UI)
  - Verify 403 Forbidden for unauthorized actions
  - Verify error message includes which permission was missing

**Expected Result**: âœ… All user flows work, permissions correctly enforced
