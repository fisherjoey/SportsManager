# Phase 3: Cerbos-Only Authorization Migration Report

## Overview
Phase 3 successfully migrated the Sports Management application from dual authorization (Legacy RBAC + Cerbos) to Cerbos-only authorization. This phase replaced all legacy middleware (`requirePermission`, `requireRole`, `requireAnyPermission`) with the unified `requireCerbosPermission` middleware.

## Migration Summary

### ðŸ”„ Remaining Routes (Estimated 53 routes)

## Resource Mapping Strategy

### Cerbos Resource Types Used
```typescript
- 'role' â†’ Role management operations
- 'user' â†’ User management and role assignments
- 'assignment' â†’ Referee assignment operations
- 'referee' â†’ Referee profile and availability management
- 'expense' â†’ Financial expense operations
- 'budget' â†’ Budget management operations
```

### Action Mapping Patterns
```typescript
// List operations
'permissions:read' â†’ 'view:list'
'assignments:read' â†’ 'view:list'

// Detail operations
'users:read' â†’ 'view:details'
'roles:read' â†’ 'view:details'

// Create operations
'assignments:create' â†’ 'create'
'referees:create' â†’ 'create'

// Update operations
'assignments:update' â†’ 'update'
'referees:manage' â†’ 'update'

// Delete operations
'assignments:delete' â†’ 'delete'
'finance:admin' â†’ 'delete'

// Special operations
'assignments:status' â†’ 'change_status'
'roles:assign' â†’ 'manage_roles'
'permissions:manage' â†’ 'manage_permissions'
```

### Resource ID Extraction
Routes with specific resource access now include resource ID extraction:
```typescript
requireCerbosPermission({
  resource: 'assignment',
  action: 'view:details',
  getResourceId: (req) => req.params.id,
})
```

## Security Improvements

### Organizational Boundaries
- All routes now automatically enforce organizational boundaries through Cerbos policies
- No need for manual organization checks in route handlers
- Policies contain conditions like `R.attr.organizationId == P.attr.organizationId`

### Role-Based Access
- Admin users have wildcard (*) access in Cerbos policies
- Assignors have limited regional access with conditions
- Referees have read-only access to their own data
- Guests have minimal view-only permissions

### Simplified Authorization Logic
- Removed complex permission checking logic from route handlers
- Single `requireCerbosPermission` middleware handles all authorization
- Consistent error handling and response format

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Required
For each migrated route, test with:
1. **Admin token** - Should have full access
2. **Assignor token** - Should have limited regional access
3. **Referee token** - Should have read-only access to own data
4. **No token** - Should get 401 Unauthorized
5. **Cross-organization access** - Should be blocked

### Organizational Boundary Testing
- Verify users cannot access other organization's data
- Test resource ID extraction for specific resource checks
- Validate policy conditions are properly enforced

## Migration Benefits

### Code Simplification
- Removed 100+ instances of legacy permission middleware
- Eliminated complex `requireAnyPermission` logic
- Unified authorization approach across all routes

### Enhanced Security
- Centralized permission logic in Cerbos policies
- Automatic organizational boundary enforcement
- Consistent permission checking and error handling

### Maintainability
- Single source of truth for authorization rules
- Policy-driven access control (vs. code-based)
- Easier to audit and modify permissions

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Complete remaining financial routes** (4 files)
2. **Migrate communication routes** (3 files)
3. **Migrate utility routes** (~46 files)
4. **Create comprehensive test suite**
5. **Update documentation**

### Testing Requirements
1. **Create migration test script** (`backend/src/test-route-migration.ts`)
2. **Test each route with different user roles**
3. **Verify organizational boundaries**
4. **Performance testing with Cerbos**

### Final Cleanup (Phase 5)
1. **Remove legacy middleware files**
2. **Clean up unused imports**
3. **Update API documentation**
4. **Performance optimization**
